# How I worked on this project

**My goal**: After building a full-stack application, I thought I would take a small break and build s single-page website

- I built this site based upon a conglomeration of sites.
- The CSS is a bit more intermediate, with the use of variables and different units

# How to navigate this project

- responsive CSS to give users on multiple devices the same full experience [example code](https://github.com/JoshuaCMorgan/business_homepage/blob/9b9ff60e98031f76db4d673619a6ac74f1341756/src/index.css#L239)
- Made navigation dropdown window scalable by incorporating `getBoundingClientRect` from `DOMRect` API. If page links are added at a later, there is no need to have to change the code base. [code](https://github.com/JoshuaCMorgan/business_homepage/blob/9b9ff60e98031f76db4d673619a6ac74f1341756/src/components/Navbar.jsx#L16)

# Why I built the project this way

- The business website is simple and effective for the end user. They want to know quickly and easily what the business has to offer and how to make contact.

# If I had more time I would change this:

- build out the site further by adding a "packages" page to showcase what the business offers the customer.
  - This could entail more info on the packages, or more info on the product such as 'ceramic coating'.
- maybe add sliding window of customer reviews.
- add video of business
- add some business features such as contact mechanisms, maps.
